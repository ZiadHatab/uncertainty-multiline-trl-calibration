# Uncertainty Multiline TRL Calibration
A multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration inclusive linear uncertainty propagation capabilities.

## About the implementation

This is an extension of my original [mTRL algorithm](https://github.com/ZiadHatab/multiline-trl-calibration) [1]. I used METAS UncLib [2] package in my code so I donâ€™t need to derive the Jacobians myself. I included additional math to cope with different uncertainty types and for everything to work cohesively. 

All uncertainties are defined as covariance matrices as function of frequency. If only one covariance matrix is given, the code will repeat it along the frequency. If only a scalar variance is given, then a diagonal covariance matrix is generated and repeated along the frequency. 

For those of you interested on how I approached the problem, you can read a summary of the work in [3]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10209)

## Code requirements

You need to have the following packages installed in your python environment:

```powershell
python -m pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-rf metas_unclib matplotlib
```

Of course, you need to load the file `umTRL.py` into your main script (see the examples).

## How to use

Here is a simple pseudo-code on how it works. If you use the uncertainty mode, all data will be in METAS uncertainty type (except for calibrated network, those are provided as a skrf type). The functions to shift reference plane and to renormalize the impedance are the same as in my other [repo](https://github.com/ZiadHatab/multiline-trl-calibration).

```python
import skrf as rf
import numpy as np
import metas_unclib as munc
munc.use_linprop()

# my code
from umTRL import umTRL

# Measured calibration standards
L1    = rf.Network('measured_line_1.s2p')
L2    = rf.Network('measured_line_2.s2p')
L3    = rf.Network('measured_line_3.s2p')
L4    = rf.Network('measured_line_4.s2p')
SHORT = rf.Network('measured_short.s2p')

lines = [L1, L2, L3, L4]
line_lengths = [0, 1e-3, 3e-3, 5e-3]  # in units of meters
reflect = SHORT
reflect_est = -1
reflect_offset = 0

# uncertainties (simple case of providing variances)
# S-parameters measurement uncertainties 
sigma     = 0.002 # iid AWGN
uSlines   = sigma**2 # measured lines
uSreflect = sigma**2 # measured reflect 

ulengths  = (0.02e-3)**2  # uncertainty in length
ureflect  = np.array([0.01, 0])**2  # uncertainty in the reflect standard

# mismatch uncertainty (check example 2 or 3)
uereff_Gamma = np.array([0.05, 0.5e-4, 0.002, 1.5e-7])**2 

# define the calibration
cal = umTRL(lines=lines, line_lengths=line_lengths, reflect=reflect, 
               reflect_est=reflect_est, reflect_offset=reflect_offset, 
               ereff_est=ereff_est, switch_term=None,
               uSlines=uSlines, ulengths=ulengths, uSreflect=uSreflect, 
               ureflect=ureflect, uereff_Gamma=uereff_Gamma,
               )

cal.run_umTRL()      # run mTRL with uncertainty evaluation
# cal.run_mTRL()  # this runs mTRL without uncertainties. Very fast, as METAS package not used.

dut = rf.Network('measured_dut.s2p')
cal_dut, cov = cal.apply_cal(dut)  # apply cal to a dut and return also frequency-dependent covariance

# propagation constant and effective relative dielectric constant
gamma = cal.gamma
ereff = cal.ereff

```

## How to define covariance matrices

If you look in the above example, or even in the other examples, you will notice that I never actually fully define a covariance matrix, not to mention a frequency-dependent one. In most cases, you probably would never actually define a full covariance matrix. However, Iâ€™m almost certain that this will cause confusion to some people. So, I will demonstrate here the most general case, and go down to the most simple case.

Before I talk about how you write covariance matrices for mTRL calibration. Let me summarize some basics you should be aware of when dealing with covariance matrices:

- The covariance of a real scalar is just the variance (scalar).
- The covariance of a complex scalar is a 2x2 matrix. The first entry is for the real part, the second for the imaginary part (If already known in polar coordinates, you need to transform it to cartesian coordinates).
- The covariance of a *NxM* real matrix is a *(NM)x(NM)* matrix. To be honest, covariance is actually defined for vectors. The way people generalized it to matrices is by computing the covariance of the vectorized version of the matrix using the [vec() operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization_%28mathematics%29), which basically creates a vector from the matrix by stacking its columns. That is way the covariance has a dimension of *(NM)x(NM)*.
- The covariance of a *NxM* complex matrix is a *(2NM)x(2NM)* matrix. This is because we actually have two matrices, one for the real part and the second for the imaginary part. Remember, the order is real then imaginary, for each element.
- If the elements in a matrix (or vector) are independent, then the corresponding covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements are the variances of the elements.

### frequency-dependent covariance

This is the most general case, where you know the covariance at each frequency point. We do, however, assume independency between the frequency points. For example, if we have *K* frequency points of 2-port S-parameters measurement. The resulting covariance would be a 3D array of the size: *Kx8x8.* Basically, we have at each frequency point a 8x8 covariance matrix.

```python
covS = np.array([ [[cov1]], [[cov2]], ...,  [[covK]] ])
```

Another example, which is maybe unrealistic, letâ€™s assume we have *N* line standards with uncertainty in their lengths. Letâ€™s assume, the machine that made the transmission lines has some memory effect, where every time it moves to fabricate another transmission line the uncertainty of the previous line effects the uncertainty of the next line (i.e., correlation). Now, to make it even more unrealistic, let say the uncertainty changes with frequency (maybe this is actually possible when discussing metamaterial ðŸ˜‰). In any case, the size of the total covariance is now *KxNxN* (remember, we have at each frequency point a *NxN* covariance, as we are working with lengths, i.e., real numbers)*.*

### frequency-independent covariance

So, letâ€™s say the covariance repeats along the frequency. One way to define the total covariance is just to repeat a the single covariance *K*-times:

```python
Cov = np.tile(cov, reps=(K,1,1))
```

Alternatively, I wrote my mTRL code so that you can just give the code only a single covariance and it will repeat it along the frequency automatically. You just write

```python
Cov = cov  # where cov is a single covariance of a set of paramters, e.g., S-paramters or lengths ... 
```

### correlation-free covariance

In some cases, the covariance might describe independent elements, i.e., the covariance is a diagonal matrix. In such cases you could just write the diagonal matrix directly like

```python
cov = np.diag([var1, var2, ..., varN])
```

Alternatively, you could just pass the vector directly. I wrote the code such that it diagonalize it automatically if given a vector:

```python
cov = np.array([var1, var2, ..., varN])
```

### equal-variance covariance

The most simple case, you find me using it often, is when you assume all parameters having the same variance and are independent. Basically, the covariance matrix is a variance value multiplied by an identity matrix.

```python
cov = var*np.eye(N)
```

In my code, you can just pass a scalar as covariance and the code will automatically expand it to a diagonal matrix. 

```python
cov = var
```

For example, I often use this to assign uncertainty in the length of the lines.

### what you cannot do
If your covariance matrix is frequency-dependent, then you have to define it manually, as in the first general case. Even if it is only constructed from variances. If it changes with frequency, you need to explicitly define the covariance matrix at each frequency point. The simplification cases I mentioned before are meant to be used when you have frequency-independent covariance/variance. 

## TO-DO

This is ongoing work and it will continuously get updated. For now, there are a few things I planned:

- The code at the moment takes only one reflect standard. To be honest, I intentionally want it to handle only one reflect standard, as the code is starting to get messy. I will update the code later to take multiple reflect standards.
- I want to include a function that takes wave quantities (a and b waves) and convert them to S-parameters with their covariance matrix. This is actually not difficult to implement. My biggest issue is that every VNA instrument gives you the wave quantities as csv file, and they all use different format. Maybe someone knows a standardized way to handle wave quantities?
- I will try to include connecter, probing and repeatability uncertainties. Iâ€™m not sure exactly about the details, but I will figure that out. At the moment the code can handle the following uncertainties: measurement, length, reflect and mismatch uncertainties.
- I said this in my other [repo](https://github.com/ZiadHatab/multiline-trl-calibration), I will also try here to include a proper documentation for this code (Iâ€™m bad at time management, so donâ€™t expect it any time soon). For now, if anyone has a question, just ask me directly here or write me at zi.hatab@gmail.com (or z.hatab@tugraz.at).

## Examples

### example 1 â€” on-wafer ISS calibration

This example shows you how to perform 1st-tier mTRL calibration with uncertainty treatment. The variances that I have given in this example are not the actual uncertainties of the calibration standards nor the VNA. I just roughly estimated some numbers to showcase how the code works.

### example 2 â€” linear uncertainty (LU) vs. Monte Carlo (MC)

According to GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement), the best way to verify the validity of linear uncertainty propagation is by comparing it against full Monte Carlo method. So, to mimic a scenario where there are randomness in the calibration standards, I opted for simulated data, where I can control everything about the standards. In below images I considered all uncertainties (except switch terms), and MC was done for 100 trials (it gets better if you increase the trials, and slower!).

### example 3 â€” contribution of each uncertainty type

This is basically a breakdown of the previous example, where I show the contribution of each input uncertainty in the output uncertainty.
